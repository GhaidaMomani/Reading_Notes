## Practice in the Terminal
**Tasks** 
Working as a tech professional will often involve interacting with the terminal on your computer.

This pre-work will introduce you to some of the more common commands involved in traversing directories and manipulating files on your computer.

## summarizing my observations

-  What is a Linux shell?
A shell is a command interpreter that exposes an interface to the user to work with the underlying operating system.
It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users advanced features like being able to create scripts.
This is important: shells let you perform things in a more optimized way than a GUI (Graphical User Interface) could ever possibly let you do. Command line tools can offer many different configuration options without being too complex to use.
- The Linux man command
The first command I'll introduce will help you understand all the other commands.

- The Linux ls command
Inside a folder you can list all the files that the folder contains using the ls command.

- The Linux cd command
Once you have a folder, you can move into it using the cd command. cd means change directory. You invoke it specifying a folder to move into. You can specify a folder name, or an entire path.
- The Linux pwd command
Whenever you feel lost in the filesystem, call the pwd command to know where you are:
- The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept.

## Permissions (for extra credit)

* Linux being a multi-user system uses permissions and ownership for security.
There are three user types on a Linux system viz. User, Group and Other
* Linux divides the file permissions into read, write and execute denoted by r,w, and x
* The permissions on a file can be changed by ‘chmod’ command which can be further divided into Absolute and Symbolic mode
* The ‘chown’ command can change the ownership of a file/directory. Use the following commands: chown user file or chown user:group file
* The ‘chgrp’ command can change the group ownership chrgrp group filename
What does x – eXecuting a directory mean? A: Being allowed to “enter” a dir and gain possible access to sub-dirs.
