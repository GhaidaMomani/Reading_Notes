## How to use the Random Module in Python
**Overview** 

The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

**When to use it?**

We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.

## Random functions
**Randint** It accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

**Random** If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

**Choice** Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

**Shuffle** The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

**Randrange** Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)






# Risk analysis

## Why use Risk Analysis?
In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.





## There are several stages of risk analysis

**1. Risk Identification**
   * Business risks - come from your business or customer rather than from your project
   * Testing risks - be aware of your testing limitations and methods
   * Premature Release risks - be aware of implications of releasing buggy software
   * Software risks - be aware of your development process

**2. Risk Assessment**
   * Forecast problems
   * Estimate losses
   * Have an action plan
   * Learn from unwanted scenarios to avoid future consequences

**3. Perspective of Risk Assessment**
   * Effect - identify by effects of a risk
   * Cause - identify by cause of a risk
   * Liklihood - assign probability of a risk

## How to perform Risk Analysis?

There are three steps:

1- Searching the risk

2- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

3- Measures for the risk identified

## Now, you must know there are certain risks that are unavoidable.
1. The time that you allocated for testing

2. A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application

3. Urgency from the clients to deliver the project

4. Incomplete requirements




## Things we must take care of :

Conduct **Risk Assessment** review meeting

Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas

Create a **Risk Assessment** database for future use

## Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.

Now, what are these risk magnitude indicators? Well, here is an explanation.

**High:** means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable. The company might face loss.

**Medium:** it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.

**Low:** it is tolerable. There lies little or no external exposure or no financial loss.

Moving on! Our next topic queued is as follows:
## Big O

* steps get added
* drop constants
* different inputs get different variables
* drop non-dominant terms
