By [ Alain de Botton ] (https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

## Description
**About The video**

Alain de Botton examines our ideas of success and failure -- and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments. Is success always earned? Is failure? He makes an eloquent, witty case to move beyond snobbery to find true pleasure in our work.

## Quote


"The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded, the good at the top, bad at the bottom, exactly done as it should be, is impossible. "
