# Trees

In this tutorial, we’ll be covering Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and K-ary Trees. We will review some common terminology that is shared amongst all of the trees and then dive into specifics of the different types.

Common Terminology
Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes
Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
Sample Tree



# lets answer some important questions about trees 


## What is the Usage and  analogy of trees?
Where is tree data structure used in real life?

Application of Tree:

Decision-based algorithm is used in machine learning which works upon the algorithm of tree. Databases also uses tree data structures for indexing. Domain Name Server(DNS) also uses tree structures. File explorer/my computer of mobile/any computer

Trees are used in many areas of computer science, including operating systems, graphics, database systems, and computer networking. Tree data structures have many things in common with their botanical cousins. A tree data structure has a root, branches, and leaves.

##  WHY, WHAT, HOW Trees?
* **Why Tree?** Unlike Array and Linked List, which are linear data structures, tree is hierarchical (or non-linear) data structure. If we organize keys in form of a tree (with some ordering e.g., BST), we can search for a given key in moderate time (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays)

* **What are Tress?**
A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value, a list of references to nodes (the “children”)
