## That price is **pain**, the **pain** of growth.

## Description
So this is a motivation and a kind of introduction for the next phase of this course, it focuses on the psychological manner and feelings that students encounter. The best thing about it is that it is realistic in a shocking way. I have never enrolled in a course where they put a specific part about pain and how to manage it, how to quantify it, and use it for your good. I have to say THIS IS BRILLIANT and I love it.

Pain VS. Suffering

“Verily, knowledge only comes by learning and forbearance only comes by cultivating forbearance. Whoever aims for good will receive goodness and whoever seeks to evade evil will be protected from it.”

Muhammad BPUP

Pain vs. Suffering
Welcome to the Code Fellows 401 Python course in Advanced Software Development.
This why I love it and I have never and never will complain about it:
"Over the next 10 weeks of this course, you’ll learn far more than most people learn in 2 years of study in a University setting about software development, web app development, best practices, and the Python language overall. That accelerated learning environment is great, but it does come at a price that is felt in all spheres of life: physical, mental, and emotional."

 
 But I really have to say that pain is good,As the popular motto says No pain No gain.
 and they promised to forget or skip some workouts which is really happening and  I am sasd about it.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
##  It won't feel good but you will:

- [1]You will having to think your way through problems that you've just heared about.
- [2]  You’ll have to forge your own path toward a solution.
- [3] Search for hours and hours about something or one topic.
- [4] You’ll be pushed emotionally, constantly confronted with your own lack of understanding of a topic.
 - [4]you'll meet new people and you have to put it with their complains
 - [5]You’ll be pushed physically, and while sitting in a chair and staring at your screen and forget about your workouts,and Ramdan is commign BTW so forget about food every 2 hours for a 4 straight weeks.

# Sufferign is different:


"Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration."

Suffering is good sometimes, if you are making the proper sacrifice then you'll suffer and it's good to fulfill your potential. just listen to your own sense of meaning, and you'll get used to it as you get used to fasting. 
s
The remedy of pain that comes from a lack in understanding is searching, finding someone who can explain it to you, and this comes by asking questions 


"You’re in this class so that you can become not just a competent Python developer, but a spectacular craftsman of software with Python as your tool."


so you'll handle it :)
