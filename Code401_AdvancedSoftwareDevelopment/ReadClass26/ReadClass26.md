# Readings: Intro to Django

**The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.**


W**hy Django?**
With Django, you can take web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

**Ridiculously fast.**
Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.

**SEE HOW FAST YOU CAN START BUILDING**
Fully loaded.
Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box.

**SEE WHAT’S INCLUDED**
Reassuringly secure.
Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.

**READ OUR SECURITY OVERVIEW**
Exceedingly scalable.
Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands.

**LEARN MORE ABOUT SCALING DJANGO APPLICATIONS**
Incredibly versatile.
Companies, organizations and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things — from content management systems to social networks to scientific computing platforms.



# How Django Works Behind the Scenes
* [Link to Article](https://wsvincent.com/how-django-works-behind-the-scenes/) 


Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation. However, I find that even professional Django developers have little insight into “how” Django is actually run, both technically and legally/financially, so this post is my attempt to provide a concise overview of it all.



Key Notes:  
- Django is open source.  
- Managed by Non-profit, the Django Software Foundation  
- Code is lead by a core team of volunteers and contributors.
